# beanbot

Code for a bot written for the Midwest Illinois Livers and Friends server, re-written in Python and planning to host on a Raspberry Pi 5. May move to an arch linux box in the server. Will run Docker. I have goals of writing this in a very enterprise Python app way. I also plan on somehow microservicing a Discord bot, I'm sure it's possible. Or I might not. Is the speed of a quick command like %help worth sacrificing to make it reusable across every bot? Or maybe I make simple commands like that, a library instead. Who knows!
